  - state: The current game state
- Returns:
  - A tuple of (action_probabilities, value)

#### train(self, examples)
Train the model on a batch of examples.

- Parameters:
  - examples: A list of (state, action_probabilities, value) tuples
- Returns:
  - The training loss

#### save_checkpoint(self, folder, filename)
