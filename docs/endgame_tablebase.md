# Endgame Tablebase Integration

## Overview

This document describes the integration of endgame tablebases into our AlphaZero chess engine implementation. Endgame tablebases provide perfect play information for chess positions with a small number of pieces, significantly improving the engine's performance in endgame scenarios.

## Implementation Details

### EndgameTablebase Class

The `EndgameTablebase` class in `src/alphazero/endgame_tablebase.py` provides the following key functionalities:

- `probe_wdl(board)`: Probes the Win-Draw-Loss (WDL) table for a given position.
- `probe_dtz(board)`: Probes the Distance-To-Zero (DTZ) table for a given position.
- `get_best_move(board)`: Returns the best move for a given position according to the tablebase.

### MCTS Integration

The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm in `src/alphazero/mcts.py` has been updated to utilize the endgame tablebase:

- Before expanding a node, MCTS checks if the position is an endgame position (7 or fewer pieces).
- If it is an endgame position, MCTS queries the tablebase for the WDL value.
- The tablebase result is used to guide the search, providing perfect play information for these positions.

### Training Process

The training process in `src/alphazero/train.py` now benefits from the endgame tablebase integration:

- During self-play, the MCTS algorithm uses tablebase information for endgame positions.
- This results in more accurate play and faster convergence for endgame scenarios.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Endgame Play**: The engine now plays perfectly in positions covered by the tablebase.
2. **Faster Training**: Perfect endgame information allows the neural network to learn endgame patterns more quickly.
3. **Reduced Computational Load**: For tablebase positions, we can avoid deep MCTS searches.

## Future Improvements

1. **Larger Tablebases**: Integrate larger tablebases (e.g., 7-piece Syzygy) for even more comprehensive endgame coverage.
2. **Probing Optimization**: Implement more efficient probing methods to reduce the overhead of tablebase queries.
3. **Learning from Tablebases**: Develop methods to help the neural network learn general principles from tablebase positions.

## Testing

The `tests/test_endgame_integration.py` file contains tests to ensure proper integration of the endgame tablebase with the MCTS algorithm. These tests cover various endgame scenarios and verify that the engine makes optimal moves in these positions.
