# Project Status

1. Implement a distributed training system to leverage multiple machines for faster training.
   Status: Implemented in train.py using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel.

2. Add support for more chess variants or even different board games.
   Status: Partially implemented. We've implemented Checkers in src/games/checkers.py. Chess960 and King of the Hill variants are not yet implemented.

3. Implement a tournament system where different versions of the AI can compete against each other.
   Status: Not implemented. Need to create tournament.py.

4. Optimize the neural network architecture for better performance, possibly using techniques like neural architecture search.
   Status: Not implemented. Need to create neural_architecture_search.py and integrate it into train.py.

5. Implement a user-friendly GUI for playing against the trained AI.
   Status: Partially implemented. We've created a basic GUI for Checkers in src/games/checkers_gui.py using Pygame. Need to extend support for Chess and integrate with AI.

6. Add support for loading and analyzing real-world chess games to improve the AI's opening knowledge.
   Status: Not implemented. Need to create game_analysis.py and integrate it into game_gui.py.

7. Implement an opening book to improve the AI's play in the early game.
   Status: Not implemented.

8. Add support for time controls in the game implementation.
   Status: Not implemented. Need to update chess_logic.py and integrate into game_gui.py.

9. Implement a system for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) to automatically run tests and deploy updates.
   Status: Not implemented. Need to create .github/workflows/python-ci.yml for GitHub Actions.

10. Create comprehensive documentation for the project, including API references and usage examples.
    Status: Partially implemented. We've updated the README.md with an overview, features, installation instructions, and usage examples. Basic API documentation has been created, but needs to be expanded and completed.

11. Implement a test suite for the project.
    Status: Partially implemented. We've created tests/test_game_logic.py with unit tests for Checkers. Need to expand tests to cover Chess and AI functionality.
