# Next-Level AlphaZero User Guide

## Introduction
This guide will help you understand and use our advanced AlphaZero implementation, which includes features for both game and non-game applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/next-level-alphazero.git
   cd next-level-alphazero
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Training Models
To train models for various games:
```
python src/train_models.py
```
This will train and save models for Chess, Go, and Shogi.

### Financial Market Optimization
To run the financial market optimizer:
```
python src/financial_market_optimizer.py
```

### Web Interface
To launch the web interface with real-time visualizations:
```
python src/web_interface.py
```
Then open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8050` to view the interface.

## Advanced Features

### Adaptive MCTS
Our implementation uses adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search, which dynamically adjusts exploration parameters based on the complexity of the current game state.

### Transfer Learning
The system supports transfer learning between related games, allowing faster adaptation to new game variants.

### Explainable AI
We've implemented an explainable AI system that helps interpret the decisions made by AlphaZero. To use this feature, call the `explain_decision()` method on any trained model.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, please check the following:
1. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
2. Check that you're using a compatible version of Python (3.7+).
3. Verify that you have sufficient GPU resources for training large models.

For further assistance, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.
