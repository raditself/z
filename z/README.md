# AlphaZero Implementation

This project is an implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm for chess. It includes a neural network model, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), and self-play functionality.

## Features

- Chess game implementation
- Neural network model for policy and value prediction
- Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for action selection
- Self-play functionality for training
- Model export and import capabilities
- Web interface for interacting with the trained model

## Running Tests

To run all tests for the AlphaZero implementation, use the following command from the project root directory:

```
python run_tests.py
```

This will execute all unit tests and integration tests, providing a summary of the results.

## Project Structure

- `src/alphazero/`: Contains the core implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm
- `src/web/`: Contains the web interface for interacting with the trained model
- `tests/`: Contains unit tests and integration tests
- `run_tests.py`: Script to run all tests

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies (list them here or refer to a requirements.txt file)
3. Run the tests to ensure everything is set up correctly
4. Start training the model or use a pre-trained model

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the documentation.
