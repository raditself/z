# Next-Level AlphaZero Implementation

This project implements a state-of-the-art version of the AlphaZero algorithm, incorporating cutting-edge AI techniques, optimizations, and extensive features. It goes far beyond the original AlphaZero, pushing the boundaries of game AI and extending to non-game domains.

## Features

1. Adaptive MCTS with dynamic exploration parameters
2. Dynamic neural network with attention mechanisms
3. Meta-learning for faster adaptation to new games
4. Explainable AI system for decision interpretation
5. Transfer learning between related games
6. Multi-agent AlphaZero for multiplayer games
7. Hybrid search combining MCTS with alpha-beta pruning
8. Self-improving curriculum learning
9. Automatic feature extraction from raw game states
10. Human knowledge integration
11. Adaptive opponent modeling
12. Multi-objective optimization for balanced play
13. Support for multiple game environments (Chess, Go, Shogi, Othello, Connect Four)
14. Advanced game-specific heuristics
15. Optimized distributed training for large-scale operations
16. Sophisticated web-based interface for real-time gameplay
17. Comprehensive benchmark system against top AI systems
18. Detailed logging and visualization of training progress
19. CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment
20. Containerized version for easy deployment
21. Application to non-game domains (Business Strategy Optimization)
