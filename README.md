# Next-Level AlphaZero Implementation

This project implements a state-of-the-art version of the AlphaZero algorithm, incorporating cutting-edge AI techniques, optimizations, and extensive features. It goes far beyond the original AlphaZero, pushing the boundaries of game AI and extending to non-game domains.

## New Features

1. Non-game applications: Financial Market Optimization
2. Enhanced web interface with real-time visualizations
3. Pre-trained models for various games (Chess, Go, Shogi)
4. Comprehensive user guide
5. Cloud integration for scalable training and deployment

## Project Structure

- `src/alphazero/`: Core AlphaZero components
- `src/games/`: Game implementations (Chess, Go, Shogi)
- `src/financial_market_optimizer.py`: Non-game application for portfolio optimization
- `src/web_interface.py`: Real-time web interface using Dash and Plotly
- `src/train_models.py`: Script for training models on various games
- `src/cloud_integration.py`: Integration with Google Cloud for scalable operations
- `USER_GUIDE.md`: Comprehensive guide for using the system
- `README.md`: This file
