# Next-Level AlphaZero Implementation

## Overview

This project is an advanced implementation of the AlphaZero algorithm, incorporating cutting-edge AI techniques and optimizations. It goes beyond the original AlphaZero by including features such as adaptive MCTS, dynamic neural networks, and support for various game types.

## Key Features

1. Adaptive MCTS with dynamic exploration parameters
2. Dynamic neural network with attention mechanisms
3. Support for multiple game types (currently implemented for Chess)
4. Advanced training pipeline with self-play and evaluation
5. Modular and extensible architecture for easy addition of new features

## Project Structure

- `src/alphazero/`: Core AlphaZero components
  - `mcts.py`: Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search implementation
  - `neural_network.py`: Dynamic neural network with attention mechanisms
  - `self_play.py`: Self-play module for generating training data
  - `evaluate.py`: Evaluation methods for comparing against baseline
- `src/games/`: Game implementations
  - `chess.py`: Basic Chess game implementation
- `tests/`: Unit tests for core components
- `main.py`: Main entry point for running the AlphaZero training and gameplay
- `train_alphazero.py`: Training pipeline for AlphaZero
- `run.sh`: Bash script for easy execution of the project

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/next-level-alphazero.git
   cd next-level-alphazero
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To train and run the AlphaZero implementation:

```
./run.sh
```

This script will install the required dependencies, train the AlphaZero model, and play a game using the trained model.

## Extending the Project

To add support for new games or features:

1. Implement a new game in `src/games/` following the interface defined in `chess.py`
2. Update the `main.py` and `train_alphazero.py` files to include the new game
3. Implement new features in the respective modules (e.g., `mcts.py`, `neural_network.py`)
4. Add appropriate unit tests in the `tests/` directory

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more sophisticated game-specific logic for Chess
2. Add support for other games (e.g., Go, Shogi)
3. Implement advanced features such as distributed training and self-play
4. Optimize performance for faster training and inference
5. Develop a user interface for human vs. AI gameplay
